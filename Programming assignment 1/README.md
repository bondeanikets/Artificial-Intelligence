### Programming Assignment # 01

#### THE FOLDER CONTAINS:

2. Python file (*.py)
3. Table of performance and results discussion (*.pdf)
4. Heuristic development (.*pdf)
5. This README (*.txt)

#### INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:

1. Extract the blocksworld.py file
2. Open the terminal window and 'cd' to the path where this program is stored. 
3. Run the code by typing 'python bocksworld.py' followed by two numbers corresponding to 'number of blocks' and 'number of stacks' respectively.
   * (example: "python bocksworld.py 5 3", where number of blocks = 5, number of stacks = 3)
4. All the results will show up on the Command Window.
5. If you want to check the output for some custom stack, git it as the input in the program to the 'master' variable
